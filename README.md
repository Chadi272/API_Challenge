# Readme
* The repository includes a WeatherPy and VacationPy jupyter notebook  for the main scripts
* The map is a screenshot of the VacationPy heatmap created with clickable markers
* World_cities csv is the excel file used by CityPy to retreive cities from latitude and longitude
* Weather_info is exported dataframe from the WeatherPy and then used in VacationPy
* API_keys python file, containes the gmaps and weather API keys for a successful connection

## Data Frame Observations

### Northern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Based on the negative correlation we can conclude:
  * As the coutry moves further to the north, the maximum temperature decreases

### Southern Hemisphere - Max Temp vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Based on the positive correlation we can conclude:
  * As the coutry moves closer to the equater, the maximum temperature increases
  
### Northern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Based on the negative correlation we can conclude:
  * As the coutry moves further to the north, the humidity decreases
  
### Southern Hemisphere - Humidity (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Based on the negative correlation we can conclude:
  * As the coutry moves closer to the equater, the humidity decreases
  
### Northern Hemisphere - Cloudiness (%) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Based on the negative correlation we can conclude:
  * As the coutry moves further to the north, the cloudiness decreases
  
### Southern Hemisphere - Wind Speed (mph) vs. Latitude Linear Regression
* Based on the negative correlation we can conclude:
  * As the coutry moves closer to the equater, the wind speed decreases
